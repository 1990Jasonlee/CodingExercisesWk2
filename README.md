# CodingExercisesWk2
a group coding exercise

Do this in either Java or Python. Your choice.

#### Code Exercises

- For loop from 100 to 5 by 5
- Sum Integers from 9 to 17, print sum
- Find smallest integer in an array
- Find largest integer in an array
- Find and print index of first true element in an array of booleans
- Find and print index of first true element in an array of booleans (use a while loop)
- add 5 to every element of an array of integers
- divide each element of a double array by 1.3
- raise each element of a double array to it's 3rd power and subtract the original element's value by the value divided by 3.0
- zero out a 4 by 6 integer array
- multiply each element of a 5 by 5 array of integers by 7
- create a method that takes a 5 by 5 array and produces a 5 by 5 array of booleans. each element in the result should be true if the value in the argument array is even, else it's false.
- create a method that takes two doubles and returns the first parameter raised to the second parameter's value
- create a method that returns a boolean if the Object passed to it is a Fish or not
- There is an object x which has a method (double)Balance(). Build an IF statement that prints "Paid Off" if the result of the balance call is less than of equal to 1.0, else it prints the balance as a Dollar figure (2 decimal places) 
- Build a WHILE loop that turns on the heat if the thermo.getTemp() is less than 72.0 else it turns on the A/C if thermo.getTemp() is greater that 76.0.
- Find a number greater than Pi in a double array, print number and its index.
- Given an array of objects (of class Xaction) w/nulls, sum all the values of the objects in the array, using Xaction::getValue(). Print the sum.
- reverse an array of objects of type Xaction
- Print a 5's times table
- detemine the hypotenuse of a 9 by 7 right triangle, assign it to a double

Use groups of 2-4, each group at a whiteboard, sketching out the answers.
